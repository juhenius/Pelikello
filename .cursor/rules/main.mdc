# Pelikello Project Rule

- The project must adhere to the architecture and design principles defined in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md.
- All features, code, and design decisions should prioritize privacy, local-only operation, transparency, and extensibility as outlined in the architecture document.
- Any new code or feature must not introduce cloud dependencies, third-party analytics, or internet-based remote access.
- Refer to doc/ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed component descriptions, technology stack, and guiding principles.
